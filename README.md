# Personal-AI-Assistant (Jarvis)

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI Virtual Assistant (Jarvis) project, source code will be readily available soon as it is still in the developmental stage! This project is a personal AI assistant implemented in Python, inspired by the virtual assistant featured in the Iron Man movies. The AI assistant uses speech recognition to process user commands, natural language processing to understand the intent, text-to-speech to provide responses, and face recognition for personalized user interaction.

## Features

- Speech recognition for capturing user commands.
- Natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from user input.
- Text-to-speech (TTS) for delivering personalized responses.
- Face recognition for personalized greetings and interaction.
- Web search, Wikipedia queries, API.
Error handling for robust user interaction.
- **Customizable with APIs**:
    - Notes App Integration: Save and retrieve user-specific notes or to-do lists.
    - Google Calendar Integration: Add, update, and read events from the user's Google Calendar.
    - Weather API: Provide current weather updates for the user's location or specified location.
    - News API: Fetch latest news headlines or specific news topics for the user.
    - Translation API: Translate phrases or text into different languages.
    - Email API: Read, compose, and send emails via voice commands.
    - Social Media API: Post updates on social media platforms using voice commands.
    - Smart Home API: Control smart home devices (lights, thermostats, etc.) via voice commands.
    - Custom API: Add your own APIs to extend functionality according to your preferences.

Please note that the availability and usage of these APIs may depend on their respective terms of service and authentication requirements. Users can choose to enable or disable specific APIs based on their preferences and needs.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the project to add more APIs and customize Jarvis to meet your specific requirements!
By mentioning the integration of various APIs in the README, potential users and contributors will be aware of the extensibility and customization possibilities offered by your AI Virtual Assistant. It will also encourage them to explore and contribute to the project by adding new APIs and functionalities according to their preferences and use cases.

Make sure to include documentation or code examples within the project that demonstrate how users can enable, configure, and use the different APIs to personalize their Jarvis experience. The documentation will serve as a helpful resource for users who want to explore the full potential of your AI Virtual Assistant.
